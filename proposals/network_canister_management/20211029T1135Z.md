# Upgrade frontend NNS Dapp canister to commit f67df91

Wasm hash: dd5d50b3b8c277df99bc1c826ec00d95f97144de16e3a967c2f950ad72314a97 (https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/runs/4045805736?check_suite_focus=true)

## Change Log:

* Display the payloads of 'Execute NNS Function' proposals
* Allow markdown in proposal summaries
* Display the new 'title' field on proposals
* Add a `metrics` endpoint for creating dashboards on Prometheus.
* Fetch accounts, balances, and neurons more securely. Rather than fetching sensitive data (e.g. ledger balances) as query calls, we now fetch the data twice in parallel: once as a query call for UI snappiness, and another as an update call to get a certified response. The certified response overwrites the result of the query.
* Ledger wallet: Allow disbursing neurons to a different account.
* Minor UI enhancements.
